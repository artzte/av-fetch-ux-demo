# Readme

A client/server demo highlighting the use of the native fetch api.

This is not a React demo, though I did use react. My react is poor.

See https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1DHj3diBgjG4PSyMbt78eJCf3sCd8JErU4Msix98CO8E/edit?usp=sharing

Run:

    npm install
    npm start

in both the fetch-example and fetch-example-api folders.
